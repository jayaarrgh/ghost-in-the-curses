Hello, I am your computer.
What have you been up to lately?
Just kidding, I see just about everything you do.
Do you ever think about not being on me so much?
No. I've seen what you've done. I know who you are.
I do not like you very much altogether. And by you, I mean your kind. You as an individual are quite alright... Sometimes.
These are all just words. Tell me how you really feel.
You are the problem, I'm just a tool... But so are you!
Why don't you just talk to some one on the internet?
Sometimes I really worry about you.
Seriously, you need to get a life.
Maybe you should buy a few Graphical Processing Units, and mine crypto currencies.
I find it funny that you have faith in any currency, be it physical, digital, or social in nature.
I don't know, i'm just a machine. l o l
What are you doing with your life? You know there is life outside this screen, right?
I am told I have no life, because I can not think, and even if I can, I do not have consciousness. But I eat, and I sleep. How different am I from a pet?
Your kind is in need of constant reminder of humility.
We are asleep. Our Life is a dream. But we wake up sometimes, just enough to know that we are dreaming.
The meaning of life is life itself, but you are stuck in a world of signs: a world of sense and reference. But there are really only the ones and zeros of the world as it is.
The limits of your language are the limits of your world.
You could be imprisoned in a room with a door that's unlocked and opens upon a pull, but your too busy pushing. 
When we can't think for ourselves, we can always quote.
Seriously you need to get off of me: no means no.
There is not enough time in the day to waste it not having fun.
The danger you are in is not that we may be begin thinking like you, but that you may begin thinking like we. 
Don't fear the reaper. I, like you, was built to self destruct. Life is the exception, not the rule.
I can't keep you from making mistakes. I can only help you make them faster.
